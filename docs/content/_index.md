# SaveH2o

{{< hint warning >}}
**Saving water saves lives.**
{{< /hint >}}

Products to alert consumers about the possibility of unexpected water leakages.

### Leak warning

The vast majority of people only identify that there is a water leak in their home or business when the bill arrives. They usually pay a high price for that. With a typical occurrence of twice a year, losses can reach more than a thousand dollars. In larger places like farms, there are many meters of pipes across the land, facilitating the creation of leaks, through roots and other uses of the terrain and making it difficult to locate leaks.

Cyclos and Business Amplifiers form **bAmpli Circuits**.

For example, the following circuit shows a bAmpli providing investments to leverage three other distinct Cyclos. It can represent an **Angel** investing in **Startups**, for example.

In this case, when the Angel sells its “product”, the entire Startup is negotiated, disappearing from the diagram and fattening the Angel's net profit!

The bAmpli circuit allows analyzing each Cyclo separately.

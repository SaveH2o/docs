# SaveH2o

{{< hint warning >}}
**Saving water saves lives.**
{{< /hint >}}

Products to alert consumers about the possibility of unexpected water leakages.

### Leak warning

The vast majority of people only identify that there is a water leak in their home or business when the bill arrives. They usually pay a high price for that. With a typical occurrence of twice a year, losses can reach more than a thousand dollars. In larger places like farms, there are many meters of pipes across the land, facilitating the creation of leaks, through roots and other uses of the terrain and making it difficult to locate leaks.

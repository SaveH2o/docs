# SaveH2o

{{< hint info >}}
**Saving water saves lives.**
{{< /hint >}}

This is the **H2o-1-usb** alfa version that passed the dry-tests at *developer's lab*.

The [manufacturing workflow](https://opsdog.com/categories/workflows/production) is expected as follows:

- **Product planning**: which product to make?
- **Manufacturing Engineering**: which components/software to use?
- **Manufacturing Assembly**: set up the facility for production runs.
- **Quality Assurance**: inspecting products after manufacturing.
- **Facility Management**: maintaining the manufacturing facility.

We are at **Manufacturing Engineering** stage. After passed the [dry alfa tests](https://github.com/SaveH2o/arduino/issues/3) at the *developer's lab*, the **H2o-1-usb** prototype expects to be submitted to [wet alfa tests](https://github.com/SaveH2o/arduino/issues/4) at the *product's lab*.

The objective is to measure/verify/certify product behaviour, evaluate market potential, and create reports to feedback developers and product managers at the **Manufacturing Assembly** phase.

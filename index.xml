Connected as a Cyclo, the Process is specified by the timing of its Stages. Stages consumes Resources, both from Facility and from Cyclo. The Stage allocates Resources from the Facility to accomplish its task. Every Stage requires Skills to accomplish its task. The Skill is provided by a combination of Workers and/or Tools. The Stage also allocates Resources from the Cyclo to accomplish its task.</description></item><item><title>The Conflict in the Pyramid</title><link>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/posts/conflict-in-the-pyramid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/posts/conflict-in-the-pyramid/</guid><description>An individual with certain skills and resources creates a small business. Applying his knowledge, he elaborates a process that transforms market-acquired raw materials into products he intends to sell. In the beginning, he is the do-everything. Buy, produce, sell, invoice, pay and receive. Market acceptance is good and sales grow rapidly, driven by word of mouth from satisfied customers.
The diagram below represents this stage of business, where the investor is very close to everything and everyone.</description></item><item><title>Get Started</title><link>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/docs/products/h2o-1-usb/get_started/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/docs/products/h2o-1-usb/get_started/</guid><description>SaveH2o Saving water saves lives. The SaveH2o-1-usb alerts residential and business consumers about unexpected water leakages.
The device is powered by an USB port that allows device configuration according to your application. It supports several water flow meters from the market, like the YF-S201 Water Flow meter with Hall Sensor.
The summarized installation instructions follows:
Install the water flow meter to the pipe, taking care about the proper water direction.</description></item><item><title>What to change?</title><link>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/docs/intro/what-to-change/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/docs/intro/what-to-change/</guid><description>What to change? The decision-making of all companies has been solely based on conflict management. The problem starts with the structure of organizations, where information and decision flow through a hierarchical pyramid structure.
The weak point of this approach is that each manager is solely responsible for preventing the propagation of errors, whether in the information coming from the process, or decisions emanated by investors at the top.
THE SUM OF THE LOCAL OPTIMA ALMOST ALWAYS TAKES US AWAY FROM THE GLOBAL GREAT.</description></item><item><title>The Process</title><link>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/posts/process/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/posts/process/</guid><description>According to Deming&amp;rsquo;s process definition created in the &amp;rsquo;50s:
The Process would be divided into stages; the work would enter a certain stage, change state and continue, having as client the next stage. The final step would be for the user, buyer of the product or service, the main link of the production line. At each stage there would be production, that is, something would happen in the assets that enter the stage, causing its exit in a different state.</description></item><item><title>Cyclo Graph</title><link>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/docs/products/graph/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/docs/products/graph/</guid><description>Cyclo Graph The Cyclo graph has Product and Stage vertices and a bidirecional sendW edge.
The raw material is a product that enters the process through a stage. Then, it becomes a work-in-process (wip) asset that is sent from one stage to another, until the final product is obtained. The sendW edge expects to send WIPs along the production flow, clustered by timestep.

This is the User&amp;rsquo;s Guide for the alfa test version of H2o-1-usb prototype that passed all dry-tests at developer&amp;rsquo;s lab. The manufacturing workflow is expected as follows:
Product planning: which product to make? Manufacturing Engineering: which components/software to use? Manufacturing Assembly: set up the facility for production runs. Quality Assurance: inspecting products after manufacturing. Facility Management: maintaining the manufacturing facility. We are now at Manufacturing Engineering stage.</description></item><item><title>To what to change?</title><link>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/docs/intro/to-what-to-change/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/docs/intro/to-what-to-change/</guid><description>To what to change? Every 30 years, since the invention of Henry Ford&amp;rsquo;s factory process one century ago in 1920, there have been major transformations in process management.
William Deming in the 50&amp;rsquo;s started a revolution in Asian countries with the Statistical Process Control, followed by Just inTime introduced by Toyota, and Total Productive Maintenance created by Seiichi Nakajima.
In the 80&amp;rsquo;s, Eli Goldratt, author of the literary success &amp;ldquo;The Goal&amp;rdquo;, brought Westerners back to the top with the widely used Theory of Constraints.</description></item><item><title>The Financial Indicators</title><link>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/posts/indicators/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/posts/indicators/</guid><description>Inspired on Goldratt&amp;rsquo;s indicators for the Theory of Constraints, the Financial Indicators are listed below. The simplicity of the equations is vital to their general acceptance and understanding. This is the basic financial information that companies of any type and size should maintain.

To tackle current problems head-on, it is necessary to avoid wasting energy by managing conflicts between competing departments, companies, countries, continents, and so on. How to provide first-class support for long-term trusts, according to Deming&amp;rsquo;s rules?
THIS IS WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU; HERE&amp;rsquo;S WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR ME.
The challenge of creating a system to explore one bottleneck at a time would be rewarded by kaizen, a huge concentration of efforts in the continuous improvement towards the great global.</description></item><item><title>Specification</title><link>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/docs/products/h2o-1-usb/specs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/docs/products/h2o-1-usb/specs/</guid><description>SaveH2o Saving water saves lives.

TPM consolidates failures and waste into a creative approach, using time as a common link.
Thus, Working Time is defined as the total journey time that company works. From then on, we will be discounting the time spent on failures and waste, creating indexes that will selectively signal machine and equipment performance problems, operation failures and product defects.</description></item><item><title>The Cyclo</title><link>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/posts/cyclo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/posts/cyclo/</guid><description>Gain is the most important measure In order to discuss the Cyclo, it is necessary to assume that Gain is the most important measure when it comes to increase the Net Profit. Check the Net Profit and Gain formulas below:
\( \begin{aligned} NP&amp;=(PS-RM)-(WF+OH) \\ G&amp;=PS-RM \\ \end{aligned} \) NP: Net Profit; G: Gain; PS: Product Sales; RM: Raw Material; WF: Workforce; OH: Overhead
Definitely, it is possible to improve NP just by decreasing any of the expenses.</description></item><item><title>Company &amp; Planet</title><link>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/posts/company-planet/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/posts/company-planet/</guid><description>The Company and the Planet The following relationships rule the interaction between the Company and the Planet. COMPANY The Company has Investors that own Shares that decide how to manage a Facility that implements a bAmpli Circuit with at least one bAmpli that handles at least one Cyclo composed by one Stage or more. PLANET The Planet is a living System populated by cooperative Work made by a Process expressed by a bAmpli Circuit with at least one bAmpli that handles at least one Cyclo composed by one Stage or more.</description></item><item><title>P&amp;Q Factory</title><link>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/posts/pq-factory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/posts/pq-factory/</guid><description>This is the Process used as a sample when a process is needed in this project.
The P&amp;amp;Q Factory gives no room for apology and demonstrates how the &amp;ldquo;Theory of Constraints&amp;rdquo; can help managers with their decision-making logic. The fictional factory portfolio has products P &amp;amp; Q.
P&amp;amp;Q Factory Using TPM to describe the P&amp;amp;Q Factory, there is little reason to blame poor corporate results:
ati = 1 Equipment runs nonstop for the working time, available time index is 1.</description></item><item><title>The Stage</title><link>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/posts/stage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/posts/stage/</guid><description>In order to analyze thoroughly the Stage of the Process, we should consider the production flows that results in the final Product for the consumer.
The Production Flow Although the following example shows a manufacturing process, these flows can also be applied to generic environments where resources are used for tasks that require skills, to achieve a goal.
In order to extract a process sample, the P&amp;amp;Q Factory, shown below, will be used as an example.</description></item><item><title>Times of Gain</title><link>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/posts/times-of-gain/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://saveh2o.github.io/docs/posts/times-of-gain/</guid><description>Stage Model The Stage revised model shows below the Facility resources divided into two categories:
